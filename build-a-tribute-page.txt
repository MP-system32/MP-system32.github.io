              <h3>Gandalf</h3>
              <p>Gandalf, known largely as the Grey and later, briefly, the White, and originally named Ol√≥rin (Quenya), was an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin II and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples of the World in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.</p>
